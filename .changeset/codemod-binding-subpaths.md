Check each migrated binding subpath against what the binding exports. An import such as `@base-ui/react/dialog` that the binding serves no longer reports a "check that it exists" warning, and one it does not serve, such as `zustand/middleware/immer`, is now an error naming the missing export. The CLI's binding catalog records each binding's export subpaths for this check.
