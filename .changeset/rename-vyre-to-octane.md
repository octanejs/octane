"octane": patch
"@octanejs/vite-plugin": patch
---

Rename the project from `vyre` to `octane`. The runtime now publishes as `octane` and the Vite metaframework plugin as `@octanejs/vite-plugin`. Identifiers inherited from the Ripple fork were also renamed to Octane (e.g. `setIsRippleActEnvironment` → `setIsOctaneActEnvironment`, the metaframework `ripple()` plugin → `octane()`, and the `ripple.config.ts` convention → `octane.config.ts`). References to the upstream Ripple framework and its `@ripple-ts`/`@tsrx` packages are unchanged.
