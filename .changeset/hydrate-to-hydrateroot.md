Rename `hydrate` → `hydrateRoot` and adopt React 18's shape. The hydration entry is now `hydrateRoot(container, <App/>)` — container first — and returns a full `Root` (with `.render()` and `.unmount()`), symmetric with `createRoot`. Previously `hydrate(Component, container, props)` put the component first and returned only `{ unmount }`. After hydration the returned root's `.render()` performs a normal client update against the adopted DOM (no re-hydration). The vite-plugin's generated client entry now imports and calls `hydrateRoot`.
