# react-draggable upstream provenance

This binding targets exactly `react-draggable@4.7.1`. It does not claim a
floating compatibility range.

## Vendored boundary

`upstream/npm/` is the complete unpacked npm artifact: all 26 published files,
including the exact CJS/ESM runtime, declaration files, source maps, web build,
metadata, README, changelog, and license. `upstream/tag/` contains the relevant
byte-exact repository boundary: all ten `lib/` source modules; all `test/`
files and fixtures; the `typings/` consumer program; package metadata; compiler,
build, and Vitest configuration; and the license.

## Public surface

The pinned root runtime exports default `Draggable` and named
`DraggableCore`. Its eight public type exports are `ControlPosition`,
`DraggableBounds`, `DraggableCoreProps`, `DraggableData`, `DraggableEvent`,
`DraggableEventHandler`, `DraggableProps`, and
`PositionOffsetControlPosition`. The only package subpaths are `.` and
`./package.json`.

The generated declaration also contains private bundle types and an internal
`DraggableDefaultProps` export from the non-public `Draggable` chunk. Those are
not root exports and therefore are not consumer surface. The root declaration,
not the source module's convenience exports, is authoritative.

## Exhaustive work list

The pinned repository contains exactly 204 non-browser unit/type cases across
11 test files and 23 browser cases. The type-compatibility fixture contains
explicit `expectType` assertions plus children/JSX/class probes. Test identities
include file, source line, and title so same-titled cases in different
`describe` blocks remain distinct.

Adapted public unit and browser cases live in
`tests/upstream/public-root.test.ts` and `tests/browser/parity.browser.test.ts`.
Each `adaptedCase(identity, …)` identity is the upstream citation
(`tag/test/…::title`).

## Allowed transforms

Source and type adaptations are fail-closed behind an explicit ledger. The
current `allowedTransforms` entries are:

| id | Applies to | Authorization |
|---|---|---|
| `import-root-octanejs` | adapted runtime + types | Rewrite `react-draggable` imports to `@octanejs/draggable` |
| `native-events` | adapted types | Replace React synthetic `MouseEvent`/`TouchEvent` unions with native events |
| `function-components` | adapted types | Replace `React.Component` class assignability with Octane function-component types |
| `nodeRef-prop-surface` | adapted runtime + types | Express consumer refs through Octane `nodeRef` props rather than class-component refs |

## License provenance

React Draggable is MIT licensed, Copyright 2014–2016 Matt D. Smith and
Copyright 2016–Present STRML. [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) is byte-identical to both
the pinned tag and published npm notice and accompanies this binding.
