 * Hydration marker protocol — the single source of truth shared by the server
 * emit (the `octane-ts/compiler` compiler's server mode) and the client `hydrate`
 * runtime. The server writes these comment markers into the HTML it produces and
 * the client hydration cursor scans for them to align with the server output, so
 * BOTH sides must use byte-identical strings or hydration fails.
 *
 * Values follow the Svelte/Ripple convention (`[` open, `]` close) so the
 * protocol is familiar and the marker comments are compact.
 *
 * Nothing emits these yet — SSR codegen and the hydrate runtime are built in
 * later phases of the SSR plan. This module is the shared home they'll import.
