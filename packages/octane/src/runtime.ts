// when its `hmr` option is on, plus an `import.meta.hot.accept(...)` block
// that calls `MyComp[HMR].update(module.MyComp)` when the source file is
// edited at dev time. The wrapper:
//
//   1. Defers to the current `fn` on every call — invocations route through
//      `wrapper[HMR].fn` so `update()` can replace it.
//   2. Tracks every live Block currently using this wrapper (keyed weakly via
//      a Set so reload-races don't leak). On `update(newFn)` we mutate each
//      block's `body` to point at the new fn and re-render — hook state is
//      preserved because the compiler emits `Symbol.for(stableId)` for hook
//      slots (re-imports get the same Symbol identity, so the existing
//      hooks Map continues to work).
//   3. Marks the wrapper IDENTITY-stable: HMR wrappers `Foo` and `Foo` (post-
//      reload) are the same wrapper, so `componentSlot`'s identity check
//      (`comp !== state.currentComp`) doesn't tear down on every edit.
