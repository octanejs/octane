### Patch Changes

- f8e94f2: Improve server streaming and hydration conformance for Suspense errors, aborts,
  synchronous iterables and thenables, raw HTML/style safety, controlled fields,
  and mismatch recovery.

  Compose configured app root catch boundaries inside pending boundaries so route
  errors render the catch UI while suspensions continue to render the pending UI
  on both the server and client.

- a12a3d9: Add the experimental universal renderer foundation: a bundler-neutral registry and filename resolver, static host-plan compiler target, core-owned logical topology and staged transactions, object test driver, and explicit DOM-to-universal boundary.
- 95b3081: Complete the experimental universal client renderer's core composition
  semantics: nested component owners, template directives and spreads,
  transactional renderer events, and statically declared renderer-owned child
  regions in both DOM-to-universal and universal-to-DOM directions. Normalize
  and forward boundary metadata consistently across direct compilation, Vite,
  Rspack, and Rsbuild while preserving authored source maps and normal universal
  HMR, profiling, and parallel-use planning. Add the experimental boundary
  configuration schema and the reverse DOM owner bridge used by compiled child
  regions.
- 1b21731: Keep routed hydration compatible with nonce-only Content Security Policies by
  using canonical native dynamic imports and module-relative production preload
  URLs that ignore authored document bases without duplicating page or
  pre-hydrate module singletons.
- 6cfb63d: Report browser-repaired HTML nesting with authored locations during development SSR, and collect module style-map CSS while rendering so server and hydrated layouts use the same styles.

  Negotiate streaming gzip in the built-in Node HTTP transport for eligible SSR and static text responses, including the `octane-preview` path.

- 01a20fb: Suppress the spurious Vite "dynamic import cannot be analyzed" warning emitted when the config loader imports the evaluated `octane.config` module from the cache directory. The import target is a runtime-emitted file that Vite can never analyze statically, so it is annotated with `/* @vite-ignore */`.
- d63b0d0: Extend the experimental universal renderer SDK with prepared host acceptance,
  stable-ID recreation, lifecycle and local callbacks, scoped events, prop
  codecs/resource handles, typed text and intrinsic metadata, and retained
  Activity/Suspense visibility. Add client-only renderer server stubs, omitted
  boundary regions, live-use diagnostics, and stable cross-adapter client
  reference manifests for DOM-shell hydration.

### Patch Changes

- b41a91a: Add a bundler-neutral Octane compiler and app core, a low-level Rspack 2
  compiler integration, and a full Rsbuild 2 metaframework plugin with routing,
  streaming SSR, hydration, HMR, production client/server builds, preview, and
  adapter support. Keep the existing Vite integration on the same shared core.
