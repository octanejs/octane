/**
 * Returns a store instance augmented with hooks (`store.useQuery()` and `store.useClientDocument()`) for reactive queries.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * function Issue() {
 *   // Suspends until loaded or returns immediately if already loaded
 *   const issueStore = useStore(issueStoreOptions('abc123'))
 *   const [issue] = issueStore.useQuery(queryDb(tables.issue.select()))
 *
 *   const toggleStatus = () =>
 *     issueStore.commit(
 *       issueEvents.issueStatusChanged({
 *         id: issue.id,
 *         status: issue.status === 'done' ? 'todo' : 'done',
 *       }),
 *     )
 *
 *   const preloadParentIssue = (issueId: string) =>
 *     storeRegistry.preload({
 *       ...issueStoreOptions(issueId),
 *       unusedCacheTime: 10_000,
 *     })
 *
 *   return (
 *     <>
 *       <h2>{issue.title}</h2>
 *       <button onClick={() => toggleStatus()}>Toggle Status</button>
 *       <button onMouseEnter={() => preloadParentIssue(issue.parentIssueId)}>Open Parent Issue</button>
 *     </>
 *   )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Suspends until the store is loaded.
 * - Store is cached by its `storeId` in the `StoreRegistry`. Multiple calls with the same `storeId` return the same store instance.
 * - Store is cached as long as it's being used, and after `unusedCacheTime` expires (default `60_000` ms in browser, `Infinity` in non-browser)
 * - Default store options can be configured in `StoreRegistry` constructor.
 * - Store options are only applied when the store is loaded. Subsequent calls with different options will not affect the store if it's already loaded and cached in the registry.
 *
 * @typeParam TSchema - The schema type for the store
 * @returns The loaded store instance augmented with React hooks
 * @throws unknown - store loading error or if called outside `<StoreRegistryProvider>`

  // the component, any hooks declared before it get committed while hooks after the suspension
  // point (including those in the caller) don't. On re-render when the store resolves synchronously,
  // those late hooks appear for the first time, causing a hook-order violation in strict mode.
  // By placing useEffect after React.use(), no effect hooks are committed during suspension,
  // so React treats all effects as fresh mounts on the first successful render.
  //
  // retain() is called in useEffect (after render), while getOrLoadPromise() is called during
  // render. This creates a timing gap where with very short unusedCacheTime values (e.g., 0),
  // the store could theoretically be disposed before the effect fires. In practice, this is not
  // an issue with the default 60s cache time, but it becomes an issue when `unusedCacheTime` is
  // configured to values less than ~100ms.
