# UIbench desktop matrix

This suite adapts the public desktop workload matrix from Boris Kaul's
[UIbench](https://github.com/localvoid/uibench) for Octane's unified benchmark
runner. It measures one synchronous state-to-state commit for each of the 96
published desktop cases against production React Compiler, native Preact,
Solid 2, Vue Vapor, Ripple, and Inferno controls:

- four table shapes (`[100,4]`, `[50,4]`, `[100,2]`, `[50,2]`) across render,
  remove-all, two sorts, four sparse filters, and four sparse class updates;
- four sparse updates of 100 animated boxes;
- five flat/deep tree shapes for render and remove-all;
- reverse, insertion, removal, and end-to-end/start-to-end moves across four
  tree shapes;
- the four historical library worst-case reorder patterns; and
- the `[10,10,10,10]` and ten-level binary no-change trees.

The operation names and dimensions remain unchanged so results are recognizable
to anyone familiar with UIbench. The data is deterministic and keys are stable
across every state transition.

## Provenance and licensing

The workload was specified from these immutable upstream revisions:

- `localvoid/uibench` at
  [`3acab5c1900c642b1411faf5f690be43ec2cc578`](https://github.com/localvoid/uibench/tree/3acab5c1900c642b1411faf5f690be43ec2cc578)
- `localvoid/uibench-base` at
  [`efacae672bbf4133360a928305876ee1de643e64`](https://github.com/localvoid/uibench-base/tree/efacae672bbf4133360a928305876ee1de643e64)

Neither repository contains a license text. `uibench-base/package.json`
declares only the ambiguous value `BSD`; the aggregator has no license field.
For that reason this directory does **not** vendor upstream source, bundles, or
assets. The public operation matrix and workload sizes are used as the
behavioral specification, while the model, renderers, harness, data, and styles
are fresh Octane repository code under this repository's license.

## Correctness boundary

Timing starts only after every case passes three gates across two complete
matrix passes, revisiting every `before`/`after` transition after all other
cases have run:

1. The live DOM is serialized at both endpoints into a semantic
   table/animation/tree signature and compared with the deterministic model.
2. Every keyed row, box, and tree node that survives a transition must retain
   its DOM identity.
3. Every target must report the same signatures and element counts for all 96
   endpoints. Framework marker comments are reported nowhere in the oracle and
   cannot make a target pass with missing visible output.

`cases`, `elements_largest`, and `identity_shared` are emitted as deterministic
operations for exact same-run ratio guards. A gate failure or browser error
raised during setup, warmup, or timing writes a failed JSON payload and exits
non-zero.

## Measurement

Each sample first commits the case's `before` snapshot, yields so rendering and
layout from setup settle, requests exposed browser GC, and times only
synchronous commits of the `after` snapshot. The sub-0.1 ms cases repeat that
forward transition inside each sample, with every reset commit outside its
inner timer; the harness reports the mean milliseconds per forward commit. The
case-sized repetition count overcomes Chromium's timer granularity without
mixing the inverse transition into the result. This matches UIbench's default
JavaScript-time mode; it does not request style/layout/paint timing. React uses
React 19, `flushSync`, and the repository's production React Compiler
integration. Preact uses native hooks and keyed JSX; its queued microtask commit
is awaited inside the timing window. Solid uses the pinned Solid 2 beta
production renderer, keyed `createStore`/`reconcile`, and `flush()`; private
copies of both Solid endpoints are prepared outside the timer so reconciliation
cannot mutate shared workload snapshots. Vue uses the production Vue Vapor 3.6
renderer, a keyed `v-for`, and an awaited `nextTick()` inside the timing window.
Ripple uses the production `.tsrx` compiler, a tracked snapshot, keyed `@for`
blocks, and `flushSync`. Inferno uses its native class state and public
`rerender()` flush. Octane uses the production `.tsrx` compiler and `flushSync`.
All seven previews send COOP/COEP headers, and the harness rejects a page that
is not cross-origin isolated, so sub-millisecond cases retain the browser's
high-resolution timer rather than collapsing to 0.1 ms buckets.

The suite keeps React Compiler and Preact as distinct VDOM controls and Solid as
a fine-grained reactive control. Its purpose is a faithful, compact extraction
of the workload matrix and a guard on Octane's keyed reconciler and prev-guarded
update paths, not another broad framework leaderboard; those already exist in
`js-framework`, `effectful-list`, and `recursive-context`.
