# lynx-table

The unified cross-framework table benchmark for Octane's Lynx renderer: the
krausest-style row table (`app/`, mirrored operation-for-operation from the
Vue Lynx unified benchmark matrix) driven through create / update-every-10th /
select and the update (×50) / select (×30) storms, where every storm tick runs
in its own MessageChannel macrotask so app-layer batching cannot merge them.

It has two halves with different claims:

## 1. Deterministic wire-cost gates (`run.mjs`, CI-gated)

```bash
node run.mjs [iterations]          # LYNX_TABLE_SCALES=1000,10000 by default
```

Builds the app plus the real dual-thread path (background root, async
transport, main-thread receiver, host driver) with the Octane compiler, drives
the ops through real native tap tokens over an in-process ContextProxy pair,
and reports per-operation **command counts**, **serialized commit bytes**, and
**Row component render counts**
from the `__OCTANE_LYNX_PROFILE__` counters (`@octanejs/lynx`'s permanent,
build-flag-gated wire profiler — `globalThis.__OCTANE_LYNX_PROF` on each
thread). Counts are deterministic for a fixed app and interaction sequence, so
they carry ratio guards in `../baselines/ratios.json` against the
`changed-rows-model` target — the commands and component renders a change of
that size strictly implies. Creating any number of component-owned rows must
emit one shared-template run. Selection allows two Row body executions;
update-every-10th allows `ceil(rows / 10)`. The Row counter is compiled out of
normal browser and production builds. These gates keep wire payload and render
breadth proportional to change size, not tree size. The suite runs from the
root runner:

```bash
node benchmarks/bench.mjs --only lynx-table --ratios
```

Because the in-process ContextProxy is synchronous, acknowledgements return
immediately and the storm gates see one commit per tick; the asynchronous
"renders while a commit is in flight coalesce into the next commit" contract
is pinned separately in `packages/octane/tests/universal-transport.test.ts`.
This harness starts directly on the background renderer; production
first-screen adoption and the subsequent capability handoff are covered by the
Lynx first-screen integration tests and the real-browser harness below.

## 2. Lynx-for-Web wall-clock harness (`web/run-web.mjs`, informational)

```bash
node web/run-web.mjs               # octane + all vendored references
node web/run-web.mjs --scales 1000,10000,30000 --reps 3 --cells octane,vue-vdom
```

Builds the app's `main.web.bundle` with the repo's own Rspeedy toolchain
(`scripts/build-app.mjs`), serves it and the vendored reference bundles into a
`<lynx-view>` (`@lynx-js/web-core` + headless Chromium via Playwright), drives
real clicks, waits for shadow-piercing composed-DOM predicates, and emits a
markdown report (`results/web.md`) with medians of n≥3 (fresh page per
rep) plus ratios versus the `vue-vdom` cell. Absolute milliseconds are
host-bound; the ratios are the portable claim — the report prints both.

### Reference cells

`reference/{vdom-ifr-et,vapor-ifr,react}/main.web.bundle` are vendored
black-box fixtures: ReactLynx (`@lynx-js/react`), the Vue vdom top config
(`vdom +b +ifr`, legacy id `vdom-ifr-et`), and the Vue vapor top config
(`vapor +b +ifr`, legacy id `vapor-ifr`), built once from Huxpro/vue-lynx
branch `claude/lynx-implementation-review-n2r0ie`:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm --filter "vue-lynx..." build \
  && cd packages/benchmark \
  && node harness/build-unified.mjs --only=vdom-ifr-et,vapor-ifr,react
```

then only the `.web.bundle` files are copied here. `reference/manifest.json`
records the source commit. If a reference bundle is absent the harness prints
"not measured" for that cell and continues — it never substitutes a number
from a degraded run.

### Measurement honesty rules (non-negotiable)

- No octane-only bespoke workloads: the app mirrors the reference apps'
  workload operation-for-operation, and `web/driver-client.mjs` is the
  byte-identical instrument for every cell.
- Every published number comes from the same instrument that measured the
  references on the same host in the same session.
- A cell that cannot be driven end-to-end is reported "not measured", never as
  a number from a degraded run.

## 3. Stage-decomposition instrument (`stages/run.mjs`, informational)

```bash
node stages/run.mjs --smoke --rows 1000 --allow-busy-host
node stages/run.mjs --reps 5
```

The reportable command builds control and `__OCTANE_LYNX_PROFILE__` variants,
requires `n >= 5`, opens a fresh page for every sample, alternates control and
profile order `AB / BA / AB / ...` in one host window, and runs one vendored
`vue-vdom` create sample after each pair. It records CPU/OS/Node/Chromium, host
load at both ends, medians, min-max spread, raw milliseconds, shares, and
same-window ratios. Do not run other builds, tests, browsers, or benchmark
processes during that window. The default quiet-host preflight rejects a
one-minute load average above `0.5 * logical CPUs`; `--allow-busy-host` exists
only for non-reportable smoke/debug runs or an explicitly disclosed exception.

The reusable analyzer and protocol tests are:

```bash
node --test stages/*.test.mjs
```

### Observation contract

Every directly timed interval is exclusive. The analyzer rejects a sample when
direct intervals exceed its wall clock instead of normalizing or guessing.

**FCP@10k** starts when the shared browser init hook assigns the hidden
main-thread iframe's Blob script URL (before browser load/parse/evaluation) and
ends at the first animation-frame observation where the shared composed-tree
driver sees all 10,000 rows:

1. `mt_slice_eval`: Blob script assignment through the first `root.render()`
   call, including browser load, parse, and evaluation.
2. `plan_interpretation`: time inside first-screen `renderPlanNode` walks.
3. `papi_element_creation`: time inside Element PAPI page/element/list creation
   calls.
4. `layout_flush_residual`: the exclusive wall-clock remainder. Web Core does
   not expose a stable boundary separating PAPI prop/insertion work,
   `__FlushElementTree`, DOM publication, style/layout, and observer-frame
   delay, so those costs remain named and visible rather than guessed apart.

Raw view-attach FCP is also reported for control/profile overhead and same-run
comparison, but decode/fetch before slice evaluation is outside the four-stage
attribution.

**create@10k** starts at the byte-identical page driver's `pointerdown` boundary
and ends when that same driver sees 10,000 rows:

1. `bg_replay`: native-event delivery through completion of background render,
   diff, command staging, and plan folding, stopping before outbound self-check.
2. `wire_clone_transfer`: the existing ContextProxy `dispatchEvent` interval.
3. `mt_expand`: main-thread wire-shape preparation before host preparation.
   Historical plan-wire samples measure `instantiate` expansion; rebased
   template-program samples measure incremental-run capability validation and
   freezing under the same archived profile field.
4. `papi_element_creation`: time inside Element PAPI page/element/list creation
   calls.
5. `layout_flush_residual`: the exclusive wall-clock remainder, including
   event delivery before replay, validation/prepare, non-create PAPI work,
   flush/layout, scheduling, and observer-frame delay.

Snapshots are collected from the real hidden main-thread iframe and background
worker, copied as numeric own properties, and parsed without prototype or
`instanceof` checks. The profiler extends the existing
`__OCTANE_LYNX_PROFILE__` record; its runtime branches are absent when the
define is false, and `stages/analyze.test.mjs` gates that production fold
boundary with byte-equal bundled output against a control entry.

Downstream verdicts use a declared direct-share gate: `GO` requires a directly
observed target segment (or target segment sum) to contribute at least 10% of
the operation's median attribution. Residual time never authorizes a step.

## Claims and non-claims

Command counts and commit bytes are Octane-owned costs and are gated. The
in-process milliseconds and the Lynx-for-Web wall clock are CPU/browser-host
costs — no native paint, layout, adoption, or device claim. Native gates
remain the separate Android/iOS story (`docs/lynx-native-renderer-plan.md`).
