# Weather app benchmark

An app-shaped comparison of the same responsive weather UI in native Octane TSRX,
React, Preact, Solid, Svelte, Vue, and Inferno. It is ported from Alicia Sykes's framework
implementations in
[`lissy93/framework-benchmarks`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/tree/d3f0dcd07c9223c4847baddf9bfa49f060adf24a/apps).
The original UI, styles, deterministic mock data, service behavior, accessibility
contract, and test IDs are retained; the benchmark harness drives every port through
the same observable browser interactions.

## Columns

| app | port | notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `octane-tsrx` | 5292 | `.tsrx` components, keyed `@for`, `@if`, native events, Octane error boundary, and compiler-inferred dependencies for every effect/memo/callback hook |
| `react` | 5293 | React 19 reference with functional components, explicit hook dependency arrays, `memo`, and a class error boundary |
| `preact` | 5294 | Preact functional components and hooks, preserving the upstream React-compatible architecture |
| `solid` | 5295 | Solid signals, effects, and keyed `<For>` control flow |
| `svelte` | 5296 | Svelte 5 components with runes and keyed `{#each}` control flow |
| `vue` | 5297 | Vue 3 single-file components with refs, computed values, watchers, and keyed `v-for` |
| `inferno` | 5335 | Inferno 9 native class components and lifecycle-managed async requests, refs, and keyed children |

All fixtures import the exact same weather service, utilities, styles, and mock JSON
from `shared/`. Live Open-Meteo calls remain available for manual use, but the harness
always uses local mock mode so network conditions cannot affect the result.

## Port adaptations

The following small fixes are applied equally to all seven versions:

- requests use `AbortController`, so a stale search cannot overwrite a newer city and
  unmounting cannot commit an abandoned response;
- the forecast scroll timeout is cleaned up when the active item changes;
- pressure falls back to the mock payload's `surface_pressure` field (the upstream
  component reads absent `pressure_msl` and renders `NaN hPa` in mock mode);
- the upstream 200 ms test-only headless delay is disabled by the harness's
  `benchmark=true` query;
- all documents include a shared description, favicon, and valid `robots.txt`,
  fixing the upstream fixture's incomplete Lighthouse metadata;
- the footer includes the attribution required when the live Open-Meteo API is used.

## Operations

Each independent sample starts in a fresh isolated browser context with an empty HTTP
cache and empty location storage. A throwaway context runs the whole scenario first to
warm the browser process and preview server without warming any sample context.

- `initial_ready` — the document navigation time origin until London weather is visibly
  committed after the mount effect and cold local mock fetch;
- `forecast_cycle` — 36 real click-driven updates across the seven keyed forecast rows,
  ending collapsed;
- `search_city` — submit Tokyo and wait for the loading-to-weather transition;
- `search_error` — submit an invalid city and wait for the visible error state;
- `search_recover` — submit Paris from the error state and wait for weather recovery.

Every timing stops before its correctness assertions. The runner verifies exact city and
weather output, persistence, single-expanded-row behavior, error/recovery visibility,
seven forecast rows, and finite pressure text. It also compares normalized observable
snapshots of the collapsed and expanded UIs, including visible text, state visibility,
weather values, forecast accessibility state, footer links, and a normalized element tree
that excludes framework bookkeeping comments. DOM censuses remain optimization
measurements beside these semantic controls.

## Lighthouse and shipped bytes

`weather-app-lighthouse` runs all seven production apps through Lighthouse's desktop Dense 4G
simulation with a fresh Chromium profile for every sample. It records performance,
accessibility, best-practices, and SEO scores together with first and largest contentful
paint, Speed Index, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift. The existing
`first_contentful_paint` and `largest_contentful_paint` operations are Lighthouse's
**simulated** desktop-network estimates. Separate `observed_first_contentful_paint` and
`observed_largest_contentful_paint` operations report the corresponding unthrottled
browser-trace measurements from the same navigation; they are not interchangeable with
the simulated values. Result metadata also reports the total JavaScript response
transfer bytes, uncompressed resource bytes, and number of JavaScript requests. The
upstream 80/90/80/90 category thresholds are retained in result metadata; the stable
accessibility, best-practices, and SEO thresholds are gates, while the noisier
performance threshold remains diagnostic. A browser preflight verifies visible London
weather, and every audit must load the local mock without making external requests.

Lighthouse's desktop model uses discrete network round trips, so compressed JavaScript
can change its paint estimates in roughly 40 ms steps even when observed paint and
application behavior are unchanged. Compare the modeled and observed measurements
separately and inspect the actual response transfer bytes before attributing a modeled
paint difference to rendering work.

The repository-wide `bundle-size` suite also builds all seven weather targets with the same
normalized production minifier used for its other app comparisons. Its `weather_*`
operations report raw, gzip, and Brotli bytes for the total JavaScript, authored app
bucket, and framework bucket. The displayed total models each emitted JavaScript file as
an independently compressed response and sums the app and framework buckets; it does not
inspect a server's content encoding. The framework bucket includes the Octane workspace
runtime or the reference framework's dependencies together with bundler virtual helpers.

`pnpm --filter octane-weather-app-benchmarks bench:work` is an untimed production
regression gate for Octane's compressed JavaScript and bookkeeping DOM nodes. Start the
Octane production preview first. The gate verifies London weather, all seven forecast
rows, expansion and collapse with preserved row identity, a live Tokyo search, rejected
invalid-city input, Paris recovery, local storage, and the existing application semantics
before enforcing its gzip and comment budgets. It never substitutes marker counts for
those observable correctness controls.

`pnpm --filter octane-weather-app-benchmarks bench:delivery` runs a separate,
explicitly labeled client-rendered versus streamed-server-shell delivery experiment.
Octane and React both use their native streaming renderer and hydrate an equivalent
server-rendered shell; the existing seven-framework client-rendered Lighthouse suite and
its ratio guards remain unchanged. Server effects do not run, so the shell does not
pretend to contain prefetched weather: both streamed targets still fetch the same local
mock after hydration and must satisfy the same weather and interaction checks.

## Run
