# ssr-throughput bench — Node-only SSR ops/sec

A server-side sibling to [`news`](../news/): where news measures one warm SSR
render + browser hydration, **this suite measures sustained SSR throughput** —
ops/sec, p50/p95/p99 latency, and memory growth under load — entirely in Node.
No Playwright, no ports, no browser; timing is hand-rolled
`process.hrtime.bigint()` loops over production `vite build` SSR bundles.

The subsystem under test is `packages/octane/src/runtime.server.ts` end to end:
the compiled string-concatenation fast path, the interpretive descriptor path
(`ssrChild` / `ssrHostElement` / `ssrSpread` / `ssrDeoptBlockChildren`),
`escapeHtml`, and `render()`'s suspense retry loop.

## Part 1 — news-page throughput (octane vs React 19 vs Solid 2.0 vs Vue 3.6)

Reuses the news app fixtures and build methodology verbatim: `news/gen.mjs` is
invoked as a child process at 50 and then 500 cards, each target's SSR bundle
(`octane-tsrx` `render()` from `octane/server`, react `react-dom/server`
`renderToString`, solid `@solidjs/web` `renderToString`, vue-vapor
`vue/server-renderer` `renderToString` — on the server a vapor SFC compiles to
the regular `ssrRender` string codegen, so this measures Vue's standard
compiled SSR) is `vite build`-t with
an outDir override into `dist/news-{50,500}/<target>` here — **nothing under
`benchmarks/news/` is modified** (its `src/data.js` is regenerated back to the
tracked count-50 dataset afterwards; the generator is seeded, so the bytes are
identical). Each config loops the built `renderApp()` for the time budget.

A bad octane number here (relative to react/solid, or a regression vs an older
run) points at the compiled `ssr*` helper emission or at `render()`'s per-pass
setup cost — not at any specific feature, which is what Part 2 isolates.

## Part 2 — octane-only fixtures

- **`waterfall-d{1,2,4}`** — a ~1000-node page with D *sequentially-dependent*
  `use(thenable)` `@try` boundaries (each thenable resolves on a microtask and
  is derived from the previous level's resolved value). `render()`'s suspense
  loop (`MAX_SUSPENSE_PASSES`) re-renders the FULL tree once per pass, so depth
  D costs D+1 passes; the harness prints the d2/d1 and d4/d1 scaling (ideal
  1.5x / 2.5x). A super-linear slope points at per-pass overhead in the retry
  loop (pass state setup, the `OCC`/`RESOLVED` maps), not at serialization.
  Octane-only: React/Solid stream/async SSR APIs are shaped differently enough
  that a ratio would compare APIs, not implementations.
- **`waterfall-d4-x32`** — the same fixture with 32 concurrent `render()` calls
  racing (one sample = one `Promise.all` batch). Because every pass saves and
  restores the module-global ambient state around its awaits, interleaved
  renders must not corrupt each other — the gate asserts all 32 bodies are
  byte-identical to a serial render. The "batch overhead per render" line shows
  what concurrency costs beyond 32× serial.
- **`deopt-page/{octane-fast,octane-deopt}`** — the SAME 300-card page authored
  twice: compiled `.tsrx` (static chunks + `ssrSpread`/`ssrAttr`/`ssrText`) vs
  plain-`.ts` `createElement` descriptor trees (the shape every `@octanejs`
  binding produces → `ssrChild`/`ssrHostElement`/`ssrDeoptBlockChildren`).
  Correctness gate: both bodies byte-identical after stripping HTML comments
  (hydration markers legitimately differ). **The headline number is the
  plain/compiled ratio** — the SSR authoring cliff a binding-heavy page pays.
- **`escape-heavy`** — 10k text holes whose every value contains `&<>"'`.
  Isolates the multi-pass regex `escapeHtml`; a regression here is that one
  function.

## Running

```bash
# from benchmarks/ssr-throughput (after pnpm install at the repo root):
pnpm bench                 # ~10s timed loop per config + ≤5k-render memory phase
node run.mjs 2             # smoke: 2s per config, 1k-render memory phase
node run.mjs 10 --no-build # reuse existing dist/ bundles
CONFIGS=waterfall,escape node run.mjs 5   # substring-filter configs
BENCH_JSON=/tmp/ssr.json node run.mjs     # also write machine-readable results
```

The `[seconds]` argv is this suite's iterations knob (the loop is
time-budgeted; per-op sample counts are reported). `BENCH_JSON` follows the
shared contract: ms stats under `ops.render` (plus `opsPerSec`), payload
bytes / marker counts / memory growth under `meta`, a top-level `failed` on any
gate failure (and a non-zero exit).

## Caveats / bias notes

- **Memory growth is not a leak detector.** Deltas are raw
  `process.memoryUsage()` over up to 5k renders with NO forced GC, so they
  measure allocator behavior under sustained load; small negatives (a GC
  landed) are normal. The phase is additionally time-capped (~60s) for slow
  configs — `meta.memRenders` records the real count.
- **`hydrationMarkerPairs` counts `<!--[` occurrences** — octane's marker
  protocol. It is reported for react/solid too (where it is ~0) purely so the
  octane payload overhead is visible next to their body bytes.
- **This package depends on react/react-dom/solid-js/@solidjs/web** even though
  it authors no react/solid code: the built news SSR bundles externalize their
  framework imports, and Node resolves those from `dist/…` upward — i.e. from
  *this* package's `node_modules`. Versions come from the same catalog as
  news's own fixtures.
- Sub-millisecond configs (waterfall d1) rely on per-call `hrtime.bigint()`
  sampling; timer overhead (~0.1µs) is negligible at that scale, so no
  inner-loop division is needed.
- **Octane bug found while authoring** (empirically confirmed by running the
  compiled fixture against the raw server runtime; fixture kept faithful, not
  worked around): `render()` does not normalize a ROOT component that returns a
  `createElement` descriptor — `runtime.server.ts` uses the return value as
  `body` directly (`body = component(props ?? {}, root, undefined) ?? ''`), so
  a descriptor-returning root yields `body` = the descriptor OBJECT (which
  stringifies to `[object Object]`), while `ssrComponent` normalizes child
  components through `ssrChild`. `fixtures/src/entry-server.ts` documents this
  and routes the plain deopt page through a one-line `ssrChild` shim that does
  exactly what `render()` should (no per-node work is added, so the measured
  workload is unchanged). When `render()` is fixed, drop the shim.
- **If a run is killed mid-build** (SIGKILL — a thrown error is already
  handled), `benchmarks/news/*/src/data.js` may be left at count 500; run
  `node ../news/gen.mjs 50` to restore the tracked dataset.
