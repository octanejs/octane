# Comment-Marker Elision Plan — fewer `<!--[-->`s when they carry no information

Status: M0-M6 LANDED (2026-07-13; see each phase's note). Follow-up to the
website Elements-panel report
(a 40-deep run of `<!--[-->` before `.shell`, ~2,100 comment nodes on the home
page). Companion to docs/compiled-output-optimization-plan.md — this is the
DOM-weight axis of the same verbosity problem.

## 1. Problem statement (measured 2026-07-09, website home page)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Comment nodes after hydration | **2,122** (1,996 steady-state after client nav — NO leak) |
| SSR block pairs | 196 open / 196 close, balanced |
| Consecutive opens before `.shell` | **40** (the router wrapper stack — one pair per layer) |
| Inside the recharts SVG | **~1,674** (`<g>` 1,268 · `<svg>` 222 · `<text>` 184) |
| Bench-table rows | ~110 |
| Truly empty `<!--[--><!--]-->` pairs | 6 |

Verdict from the investigation: **not a loop, not a leak** — every pair is one
block range (component slot / control-flow / child slot), minted once and
stable across navigation. But three structural sources make it heavy:

1. **Wrapper chains**: a component whose entire render is another component
   still costs a pair per layer. The router stack
   (`RouterProvider → Matches → MatchesInner → Provider → CatchBoundary → @if
   → Match → …` × route levels) = 40 nested pairs wrapping one element.
2. **De-opt child slots**: the `createElement`-descriptor path
   (@octanejs/recharts) nests a childSlot pair per component-bearing child —
   and component-bearing @for items carry BOTH their `<!--it-->` pair AND an
   inner childSlot pair.
3. **SSR always pairs**: the server emits every pair unconditionally and
   hydration adopts them unconditionally, so even where the CLIENT already
   elides (forBlock `singleRoot`), SSR'd pages keep every comment.

Cost: DOM memory, slower tree walks (the runtime's own range walks included),
and an unreadable Elements panel.

## 2. What markers are FOR (the invariants any elision must preserve)

From the 2026-07-09 runtime/SSR audit (line refs drift; names are stable):

- **Range ownership for teardown** — `unmountBlockInner` sweeps
  `startMarker…endMarker`; `exclusiveMarkers=false` removes the markers too
  (owned), `=true` sweeps only BETWEEN them (borrowed). Null markers on a
  non-root block = owns no DOM (removes nothing); null on a root block =
  owns the whole container.
- **Move/hide operations** — forBlock reorder (`moveBlockBefore`), tryBlock
  soft-detach/reattach, `<Activity>` hide all walk the marker range.
- **Insertion anchor for empty/replaced content** — an empty block's pair is
  where a later render inserts; branch swaps insert before the slot end.
- **Hydration cursor alignment** — the client adopts each server pair as the
  block's own markers (`isBlockOpen` → `matchingClose`); the hole-aware
  `child`/`sibling` walk treats a whole pair as ONE logical sibling.
  `matchingClose` is an UNBOUNDED scan — every adoption is `isBlockOpen`-
  guarded; new no-pair paths must keep that discipline.
- **Portal parent hops** — dispatch walks stamped children between the
  portal's own `<!--portal-->` pair.
- **Streaming reveal** — `$OCTRC` walks the balanced `[`/`]` range of a
  pending boundary to remove the fallback. **@try/Suspense pairs are
  load-bearing for streaming — excluded from elision.**
- **Seeds are NOT marker-coupled** — suspense seeds are consumed by ordinal
  `use()` call order; streaming per-boundary seeds are scoped by their own
  `<!--oct-seed:id-->` comment; `#__octane_data` is head metadata. Elision
  does not touch seeding.

## 3. Elision machinery that ALREADY exists (the design language)

The plan extends proven paths rather than inventing new invariants:

| Precedent | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| `componentSlotLite` | no Block, no markers at all (same-module hookless callees) |
| `componentSlot(…, singleRoot)` | mints nothing; after render the single root ELEMENT is promoted to `startMarker === endMarker`; suspend-safe via the `finally` promotion + null-marker no-op teardown; transitions PROBE off-screen instead of committing a marker-pair WIP |
| `renderBranchSlot` single-element branch | self-marks on the element; ALSO the borrowed-marker precedent: branch blocks reuse the slot's start/end with `exclusiveMarkers=true` |
| forBlock `singleRoot` items (flags bit 1) | per-item pairs skipped on fresh client mounts; item's one element is start=end=reorder anchor. Direct-host SSR items now use the same boundary during hydration (flags bit 4); general shapes retain pairs. |
| childSlot lazy markers | lone-pure-host regime is fully anchorless; markers minted only when the value shape demands them (one-way promotion around the live node) |
| `childTextHole` | only-child primitives: zero slot state, zero comments, both sides |
| `renderToStaticMarkup` | `MARKERS=false` drops every pair wholesale (non-hydratable output) |

Also: the compiler already stamps `$$singleRoot = true` on hoisted fragment
renderers, and the runtime already reads that stamp for value-position
descriptors — the cross-module signaling channel exists.

## 4. Phases

### M0 — Measurement first (same doctrine as the size plan)

- **`comments_1k` op in the js-framework harness**: after the `run` op (1,000
  rows), count comment nodes in-page. Deterministic per framework → works
  with `--compare` AND cross-framework ratio guards (solid/ripple also use
  marker comments — honest comparison). Record baselines.
- **Deterministic DOM-weight benchmarks**: measure comment-node weight in the
  js-framework harness and ratio system. Keep performance thresholds out of
  correctness suites so implementation-preserving marker changes do not
  require browser-test churn.
- **Behavioral hydration coverage**: render representative wrapper, keyed,
  Suspense, and de-opt fixtures through SSR and hydration; assert DOM adoption,
  state, identity, events, and mismatch diagnostics rather than marker spelling.

**M0 LANDED 2026-07-09.** Three layers, all green in both compile modes:

- `comments_1k` op in the js-framework harness (payload now carries every
  collected op). Recorded: **octane-tsrx 3 · octane-jsx 3 · react 0 ·
  ripple 0 · solid 0** — the 1,000-row grid is already almost marker-free
  (forBlock singleRoot at work), so this op is a singleRoot-regression
  TRIPWIRE (+1 comment fails the absolute compare), not a ratio (references
  are 0 — no ratio guard possible). Wrapper/de-opt weight is tracked by the
  broader DOM-weight benchmarks and validated behaviorally during hydration.
- Historical per-route measurements at landing: `/` 2,123 · `/docs` 379 ·
  `/benchmarks` **17,381** (the 12 recharts cards; the M2 number) ·
  `/playground` 185. Current DOM-weight regression coverage lives in the
  deterministic benchmark/ratio system rather than route-specific ceilings.
- Historical client/SSR/hydrate counts covered five representative regimes.
  Measurements showed that same-module singleRoot already elided the Leaf layer of the chain
  (client 2 vs SSR 4); an @if with a single-element branch client-mounts with
  ONE comment total (slot rides the template `<!>` anchor, branch
  self-marks) vs SSR 4; empty-`@for` SSR emits only the outer pair while the
  client mints an empty-branch pair (client 5 / ssr 2 / hydrate 4); the
  de-opt tree hydrated to fewer comments than SSR emitted (11 vs 14 —
  adoption discarded some pairs while re-anchoring). These measurements guided
  M1-M3; current correctness tests assert the resulting behavior at the DOM boundary.

### M1 — Cross-module `$$singleRoot` stamps (small, contained)

The compiler's `info.singleRoot` analysis (body renders exactly one plain
element) currently helps only same-module call sites. Extend:

- At the DEFINITION site, stamp exported qualifying components:
  `Comp.$$singleRoot = true` (precedent: fragment renderers).
- At runtime, `componentSlot` mount falls back to the singleRoot path when
  the compile-time arg wasn't passed but `comp.$$singleRoot === true`
  (one property read at mount; the descriptor path already does this).
- The `hmr()` wrapper must FORWARD the stamp (dev/prod parity — checked by
  the octane-prod project).
- `memo(Comp)`/`lazy` wrappers don't carry it → conservative miss, fine.

Wins: client-rendered subtrees everywhere (post-navigation route content, the
playground, client-only apps). Does NOT change SSR'd pages (adoption keeps
server pairs) — that's M3. Bindings shipping plain `.ts` (recharts) don't get
stamps — that's M2.

**M1 LANDED 2026-07-09.** The compiler stamps `Comp.$$singleRoot = true` on
every same-module component whose body renders one plain element (emitted at
the module tail, so it lands on the final binding incl. the hmr() wrapper);
call sites whose callee is an IMPORTED bare identifier (no key/spread/
children) emit a `2` sentinel and `componentSlot` resolves it against the
stamp at mount. **Sharp edge found by the suite:** the sentinel initially
fired for ANY unknown bare identifier — including per-render local variables
(`const Comp = cond ? A : B`), whose identity changes across renders while
the markerless regime is pinned at first mount (broke the transition-swap
probe test). Restricted to imported bindings (immutable identity). SSR and
hydration unchanged by design. The landing measurement for a cross-module
sole child was client 0 / SSR 2 / hydrate 2. Website home steady-state client
render: 1,996 → **1,900** comments (−5% — as projected, M2/M3 carry the bulk).
Perf: same-session A/B neutral within noise.

### M2 — De-opt single-child anchoring (the 1,674-comment chart)

Runtime-dynamic (no compiler involvement), extending the lazy-marker regime:

- **hostElementBody children**: when the children value is a SINGLE
  descriptor, let the childSlot use the anchorless/self-marked regime even
  for component-bearing children whose render resolves to one element —
  promote to a minted pair only when the shape flips (the existing one-way
  promotion). Today only `pureHost` values qualify.
- **deoptItemBody component-bearing items**: the nested childSlot should
  BORROW the item block's existing range (`exclusiveMarkers=true` precedent)
  instead of minting a second inner pair.
- The website chart mounts client-side behind the hydration gate (BenchBars
  mounted-state), so M2's wins apply fully to the SSR'd home page.

Sharp edges: `clearChildContent`/reorder on self-marked slots (hostNode
tracking exists); kind-flips between regimes must keep the promotion one-way.

**M2 LANDED 2026-07-09** — as an OWNS-PARENT childSlot mode, stronger than the
single-descriptor sketch above:

- `ChildSlot.ownerHost`: a de-opt host (`hostElementBody` children,
  `renderHostTagChildren`, `hostComponent` — whose inner `<!---->` child
  anchor is gone entirely) hands its element to `childSlot`, which then owns
  ALL of the element's children — NO markers in ANY value regime (component,
  text, null), not just pureHost. Inserts append (null anchor); clears remove
  every child of the element (`clearChildContent`'s first branch, with the
  same blockless `detachDeoptTreeRefs` sweep as the marked path). One-way
  exceptions that still mint lazily, appended at the element tail: array mode
  (ForSlot anchors reconcileKeyed on a real pair). Owns-parent slots skip the
  off-screen transition swap (no `end` to commit at) and take the legacy
  swap, like singleRoot componentSlots. Hydration never enters the mode
  (server-pair adoption wins at mount).
- `deoptItemBody` component-bearing items: on client mount the nested
  childSlot BORROWS the item block's own `<!--it-->` pair as its range
  (pre-seeded slot state, the hydration-seed precedent) instead of minting an
  inner end-anchor + lazy start. The item block still owns the pair
  (inclusive teardown); `clearChildContent` sweeps between markers only.
- Landing measurement: Deopt client 12 → **8**, hydrate 11 → **9**
  (SSR unchanged at 14 by design). Website (dev-SSR e2e measurement):
  `/` 2,030 → **1,783**, `/benchmarks` 17,381 → **14,793** — e2e ceilings
  ratcheted to 2,050 / 17,000 (~15% headroom).
- Validation: full suite green in both compile modes (octane + octane-prod
  projects), hydration suites, website dev+preview e2e. A brand-new lexical
  typeahead-menu port test flaked twice under full-suite load during the
  landing (real-timer `settle()` races) — it passes 20+ consecutive runs on
  both pre- and post-M2 runtimes in isolation and in its project; not an M2
  regression.
- Perf: same-session js-framework A/B neutral within noise (run/replace/
  runlots/clear marginally better, sub-ms ops at timer granularity); ratio
  guards pass.

### M3 — Inherited ranges for sole-child wrappers (the 40-chain) + SSR symmetry

The compile-time condition is exact: a construct that is the SOLE root of a
`noTemplate` body (host `== __block.parentNode`, anchored at
`__block.endMarker`) spans its parent block's ENTIRE range by construction.

- **Client**: pass an `inheritRange` flag → the slot/branch adopts the parent
  block's `startMarker`/`endMarker` with `exclusiveMarkers=true` (borrowed —
  the branch-block precedent) instead of minting. Recursion collapses a
  wrapper chain to the outermost pair. Root-block parents (null markers) put
  the slot in whole-container mode (root precedent).
  - Teardown: sweep-between on borrowed markers ✓ (parent's markers survive).
  - tryBlock detach / reorder of the PARENT moves the same nodes the child
    references ✓.
  - Identity remount: clear between borrowed markers, re-render in place
    (today it mints a fresh pair — the borrowed path skips that).
  - Transitions: inherited slots take the singleRoot-style PROBE path (a
    marker-pair WIP commit would change the parent's range shape).
- **Server**: the compiler emits pair-skipping variants at exactly the same
  statically-flagged sites — `ssrComponent` inline form (skip
  `renderComponentFramed`'s wrap), `ssrEmitIf/Switch` without the outer slot
  pair. Frames are still created (path keys/seed order unchanged — seeds are
  ordinal, §2).
- **Hydration**: symmetric by the same compiler flag — inherited sites adopt
  NOTHING (the parent's pair was already adopted). Server and client are
  compiled from the same analysis, so pair counts agree by construction —
  same mechanism that keeps if/switch/for nesting parity today.
- **Exclusions**: @try/Suspense ranges (streaming `$OCTRC` walks them),
  portals (foreign-target ownership), `<Activity>` (hide/show walks),
  keyed component slots (`key=` forces identity semantics on the range).

This is the biggest blast radius (three layers must agree) and lands LAST,
gated on the M0 pins + the full hydration/e2e/prod-mode suites.

**M3 LANDED 2026-07-09 — the sole-COMPONENT-root scope.** What shipped:

- **The predicate** (`inheritSoleCompRoot`, compile.js — shared verbatim by
  both compile modes so client stamp ↔ server pair-skip ↔ hydration
  adopt-nothing agree by construction): a `@{}` (JSXCodeBlock) body whose
  normalized, head-filtered output is exactly ONE component-tag root without
  `key=`. Identifier, member (`<ctx.Provider>` — the router/binding wrapper
  stack), and dynamic tags all qualify. Synthetic sub-bodies (@if/@for/@try
  arms, children render-fns — statement arrays) never do.
- **Client** (`componentSlot(..., inherit)`): borrows the parent block's
  marker pair with `exclusiveMarkers=true` (the branch-block precedent), or
  enters whole-container mode when the parent's markers are both null (root /
  owns-parent parents). Identity swaps sweep BETWEEN the borrowed markers and
  remount in place (multi-root replacement bodies included — singleRoot could
  never hold those); transitions take the singleRoot-style PROBE path (a wip
  pair commit would change the parent's range shape); the borrow declines to
  the normal regimes when the parent has no coherent range (LiteBlockImpl),
  and bodies containing an inherit root are stamped lite-INELIGIBLE as
  callees so the decline is unreachable under hydration.
- **Server** (`ssrComponent(..., inherit)` → `renderComponentFramed`): skips
  the `<!--[-->…<!--]-->` frame wrap (string-tag branch included); the FRAME
  itself is still created — use() path keys and seed order are unchanged.
- **Boundary builtins** (Suspense / ErrorBoundary / Activity): excluded at
  compile time by imported name, AND declined at RUNTIME by identity on both
  sides (componentSlot + ssrComponent check the resolved comp), which is what
  makes member/aliased/dynamic tags safe to stamp.
- **Hydration**: inherit sites adopt nothing (resolved before the cursor
  probes — probing would misread the child's own first marker); legacy
  pair-ful server HTML falls into mismatch RECOVERY and re-renders to correct
  content (pinned).
- **Divergence erased**: component-form ↔ bare-form of the same markup now
  serialize identically and cross-reconnect CLEAN — the
  hydration-mismatch conformance divergence pin (Reconnecting:76/:91) flipped
  to a React-parity pass.
- **Landing measurements**: Chain 2/4/4 → **0/0/0**; ChainX 0/2/2 → **0/0/0**;
  keyed keeps 2/2/2; `<Ctx.Provider>` root 0/2/2; aliased-Suspense 6/8/8
  symmetric decline; swap-in-place both regimes; adoption-identity + recovery.
- **Website reality check** (dev-SSR e2e): `/` 1,783 → 1,743, `/benchmarks`
  14,793 → 14,447 — modest, and the profile explains it: the home page's
  weight is chart-INTERNAL client minting (~872 empty anchors + 382 `it`
  pairs inside the recharts SVG), not wrapper pairs (SSR pairs total 188; the
  40-deep root prefix is already 0). Ceilings ratcheted to 2,000 / 415 /
  16,600 / 195.
- **Perf**: same-session js-framework A/B neutral within noise (the one extra
  `inherit` check sits on the slot-mount cold path); ratio guards pass.

**M4 LANDED 2026-07-09 — the chart-internal weight (client-mount only, like
M2; SSR emission and hydration adoption untouched):**

- **Sole-child hole → owns-parent** (`childTextHole`'s object fallback,
  runtime.ts): a `{expr}` hole that is its element's SOLE child hands the
  element to the M2 owns-parent childSlot — component/element/array values
  render with NO anchor comment (arrays still mint their ForSlot pair
  lazily). One-line change; the sole-child invariant IS the ownerHost
  invariant. Primitive values were already markerless (`childTextHole`).
- **De-opt item self-marking** (`reconcileKeyed`'s `2` sentinel → resolved
  per item VALUE in `mountItem`): a pure single-element host-descriptor item
  self-marks — its rendered element is start === end (the forBlock-singleRoot
  regime) — so value-position `.map()` lists pay NO `<!--it-->` pair for
  pure items. Component-bearing / null / primitive items keep their pair.
  Two sharp edges handled: (1) a self-marked item whose value stops fitting
  one raw element (null / primitive / component) PROMOTES one-way to a pair
  minted around the current node in place (`deoptItemBody` — the keyed Map,
  reorder anchoring, and the M2 borrow all survive); (2) the pure-path
  rebuild now inserts-before-removing — the old element IS the end marker,
  so remove-first would detach the insert anchor (and the markers re-point
  to the replacement).
- Pins: Deopt client 8 → **4** (hole −2, item pair −2);
  `deopt-item-selfmark.test.ts` covers mount elision, reorder identity,
  tag-change rebuild, both promotion flips (component + positional-null),
  and teardown incl. the needs-blocks → pure whole-tree flip.
- Website (dev-SSR e2e): `/` 1,743 → **1,463**, `/benchmarks` 14,447 →
  **12,061**. Cumulative from the 2,122 / 17,381 start: **−31%** on both.
  Ceilings ratcheted to 1,680 / 415 / 13,800 / 195.

### M5 — Benchmark-fixture client ranges and a general DOM census

**M5 LANDED 2026-07-13.** This phase started from production builds of the
representative benchmark fixtures and counted every descendant of the fixture
root by `nodeType`. That separates user-visible elements/text from Octane's
comment bookkeeping and avoids treating another framework's whitespace text as
equivalent to a range marker.

| Fixture state | Octane before | Octane after | React / Preact | Visible elements/text |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| js-framework, 1,000 rows | 10,075 (3 comments) | **10,074 (2)** | 10,072 (0) | 8,051 / 2,021, exact |
| TodoMVC, 100 todos | 933 (310 comments) | **730 (107)** | 623 (0) | 517 / 106, exact |
| chat-stream, 10 messages / 21 segments | 158 (78 comments) | **104 (24)** | 80 (0) | 55 / 25, exact |
| portal-swarm, 600 closed cards | 3,826 (1,812 comments) | **2,622 (608)** | 2,014 (0) | 1,411 / 603, exact |
| portal-swarm, all portals open (whole body) | 8,229 (3,012 comments) | **7,025 (1,808)** | 5,217 (0) | 3,412 / 1,805, exact |

The same js-framework fixture authored through the generic return-JSX paths
lost its cliff: the naive TSRX variant went from 2,003 comments to **2**, and
the naive JSX variant from 4,003 to **2**, matching the tuned fixture's DOM
shape. Solid and Svelte are still reported separately by the harness because
their compiled output deliberately uses extra text/comment nodes in several
fixtures; element and meaningful-text equality is the semantic comparison.

The attribution and changes are deliberately narrow:

- `compile.js` (`makeForCall` + `planJsx`) now proves sole keyed-item roots for
  direct hosts, a component definition with exactly one unconditional host
  return, and an `@if/@else` whose every reachable arm is exactly one host.
  Imported components use the existing immutable `$$singleRoot` definition
  stamp. A missing branch, fragment, spread, children override, key, early
  return, or unknown/dynamic callee declines the optimization.
- `runtime.ts` (`forBlock`) reuses a compiler-owned trailing `<!>` as the
  list's closing marker, and an active `@empty` body borrows the list's outer
  range rather than nesting another pair. Hydration adopts the established
  server range unchanged.
- `runtime.ts` (`renderBranchSlot`) leaves an inactive client-only branch on
  its existing insertion anchor and re-enters the self-marked one-host regime
  when it becomes active. When a sole-root branch is also a keyed-item
  boundary, replacements update every exact borrower; an empty result or a
  transition commit promotes that shared boundary to one durable pair.
- `runtime.server.ts` / the compiler's SSR emitters were intentionally not
  changed. Hydratable HTML keeps the current balanced range protocol, and the
  client continues to adopt legacy/current server output. Eliminating server
  item ranges needs a versioned, symmetric SSR + hydration change and is not
  bundled into this low-risk client optimization.
- Portals keep their target-side pair (1,200 comments for 600 open portals),
  which is used for target ownership, event propagation, update insertion, and
  teardown. Suspense/`@try` streaming boundaries, transition WIP pairs,
  `<Activity>` ranges, multi-root keyed items, order-bearing value-hole
  anchors, and adjacent-text SSR separators also remain load-bearing.

`benchmarks/lib/dom-nodes.mjs` is the regression surface: js-framework,
TodoMVC, chat-stream, and portal-swarm now emit deterministic `nodes_*`,
`elements_*`, `text_*`, `comments_*`, `empty_text_*`, and
`whitespace_text_*` operations plus comment-payload/parent histograms in
`meta.dom`. Ratio guards cap total nodes while requiring Octane's visible
element/text counts to equal React's. Portal-swarm records both the fixture
root and whole-body census so target-side portal ranges cannot disappear from
the accounting.

The implementation plan was ordered by invariant risk: instrument first;
reuse already-owned anchors/ranges; extend the existing single-root proof;
then test keyed identity, state/effects/events/refs through the full suite,
branch replacement, transitions, SSR adoption, and mismatch recovery. The
SSR/hydration wire format and foreign-target/streaming boundaries stay a
separate follow-up. Normal production comparisons kept the affected work
competitive: js-framework `run` 1.8 ms vs React 6.5 / Solid 1.7; TodoMVC
`add100` 2.7 ms vs React 13.8 / Solid 2.1; chat `streamFine` 1.4 ms vs React
7.2 / Solid 3.2; portal mount/open 2.4/1.3 ms vs React 3.8/1.5. Fewer nodes
also shorten range walks and reduce DOM memory.

The exact size cost, measured against an isolated current-main worktree with
the same toolchain, is small but non-zero. The fixed codegen corpus grows
121,122 → 121,280 raw bytes, 63,229 → 63,337 minified, and 23,205 → 23,247
gzip (**+42 B / +0.18% gzip**). The js-framework production bundle grows
28,884 → 28,889 B gzip (+5 B); control-flow-heavy TodoMVC grows 28,972 →
29,115 (+143 B / +0.49%), and chat-stream 29,223 → 29,358 (+135 B / +0.46%).
That is the boundary-propagation/runtime proof cost paid by apps that use the
optimized paths; the matching js-framework, TodoMVC, and chat states lose 1,
203, and 54 live nodes respectively, while closed portal-swarm loses 1,204.

### M6 — Post-hydration counted range coalescing

**M6 IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-13.** Hydratable SSR deliberately keeps emitting the
established, explicit `<!--[-->…<!--]-->` wire format. Once hydration has
successfully adopted that tree, the client now compacts only nested ranges
that are proven to have exactly the same extent. A stack of `N` coextensive
pairs becomes one counted pair, `<!--[N-->…<!--]N-->`; `N` records logical
ownership multiplicity for diagnostics while the DOM contains only two
physical boundary nodes.

The proof is deliberately runtime- and ownership-aware rather than a textual
comment rewrite:

- compaction walks the hydrated Block/Scope ownership graph bottom-up and
  requires one live range-bearing child plus exact DOM adjacency
  (`outer.start.nextSibling === inner.start` and
  `inner.end.nextSibling === outer.end`);
- every owner is retargeted to the retained pair, with the inner owners marked
  as borrowers so teardown, replacement, transitions, and reconciliation do
  not remove a shared endpoint;
- compiler-proven sole renderable-child wrappers carry an explicit flag so
  binding-bag bookkeeping cannot obscure the otherwise exact runtime proof;
- keyed component boundaries, keyed-list outer ranges, Suspense/`@try`,
  `<Activity>`, portals, fragment refs, and non-coextensive control flow remain
  physical barriers. Independent keyed items and active try bodies may still
  compact internally without merging across their ownership boundary;
- counted payloads use a canonical positive-safe-integer grammar, and range
  matching still treats a counted marker as one physical nesting level. The
  multiplicity is metadata, not an instruction to skip or synthesize DOM.

That final point is why the safe representation is a counted **pair**, not one
comment total: mutable ownership still needs both a start and an end insertion
boundary. On the website's shared router prefix, 19 logical opening ranges are
now represented by five physical opening comments; the other four endpoints
start ranges with genuinely different spans and cannot be merged without
changing teardown or insertion semantics.

Production website measurements against a clean worktree at the same
`origin/main` commit (after hydration and a 400 ms settle) were:

| Route | All body comments | Octane range comments | Shared `<main>` prefix |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `/` | 2,439 → **2,315** (−124) | 542 → **418** | 19 → **5 physical / 19 logical** |
| `/docs` | 383 → **227** (−156) | 382 → **226** | 19 → **5 / 19** |
| `/benchmarks` | 18,213 → **18,079** (−134) | 2,824 → **2,690** | 19 → **5 / 19** |
| `/playground` | 165 → **69** (−96) | 164 → **68** | 19 → **5 / 19** |
| `/view-transitions` | 189 → **81** (−108) | 188 → **80** | 19 → **5 / 19** |

Raw SSR comment counts are unchanged (`/` 545, `/docs` 383,
`/benchmarks` 2,861, `/playground` 167, `/view-transitions` 189). This keeps
streaming, old server output, and hydration recovery unambiguous; the saving is
applied only after successful client adoption. The general DOM census now
reports physical and logical hydration markers, counted-marker count, maximum
multiplicity, and physical/logical leading opens so future regressions remain
visible independently of user-visible elements and text.

Hydration records whether range matching encountered any physically adjacent
pair before considering compaction. Roots without one skip the ownership walk;
eligible roots pay one hydration-only, linear walk plus the comment removals.
Normal client mounts, SSR output, and steady-state update traversal do not run
the compactor. Focused coverage pins adoption identity, events/state, branch
replacement, keyed reorder identity, direct- and return-position Suspense
barriers, mismatch recovery, streaming scanning, and both development and
production compilation.

The production `news` hydration benchmark is a useful overhead control because
its 52 independent pairs have no coextensive adjacency to remove, so the new
candidate guard skips the ownership walk: its census stays at 763 nodes / 104
physical and logical hydration comments before and after. Across 20 fresh-page
samples, Octane TSRX hydration measured 1.30 ms on this branch versus 1.3125 ms
on the clean-main run (1.30 ms median and 1.40 ms p95 in both). Treat that
0.0125 ms difference as noise, not a claimed speedup; the result shows no
measurable no-op regression. In the branch's same uncontended run, React
measured 2.40 ms, Preact 1.70 ms, Solid 1.70 ms, and Svelte 1.3875 ms. Adoption
identity, 50-card content, and interaction gates all passed.

The deterministic size tradeoff is modest: the fixed compiled corpus grows by
51 raw / 37 minified / **1 gzip byte**. The production TSRX js-framework
bundle grows 29,682 → 30,017 gzip bytes (**+335 B / +1.13%**), almost entirely
in the framework chunk (the app chunk shrinks by 2 B); the JSX fixture grows
29,689 → 30,041 (**+352 B / +1.19%**). TodoMVC and chat grow 358 B / 379 B
gzip. This is the counted-marker parser, ownership proof, and no-op guard cost;
normal app codegen is effectively unchanged.

**Still open (small or order-constrained — diminishing returns):**

1. Multi-hole hosts: the remaining ~684 empty anchors on `/` are
   order-bearing (`<g>{a}{b}</g>` — siblings need stable positions); eliding
   them needs per-hole neighbor bookkeeping. Biggest remaining bucket.
2. Component-bearing `it` pairs (145 on `/`) — required borrow ranges today.
3. Sole-root `@switch` construct inherit + children-render-fn /
   value-position sole roots (M3 leftovers).
4. Remaining SSR payload size: direct-host `@for` items now omit their pairs
   symmetrically on the server and during hydration. Other M6 ranges still
   compact only after successful hydration; omitting those from the wire needs
   the same server/client ownership proof and streaming compatibility.

### Ordering & measured effect

M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5 → M6. M1-M5 remove ranges at the
compiler/runtime source for client-created content; M6 complements them by
compacting redundant ranges that must remain explicit in the SSR wire format.
The original home-page report's 40-opening wrapper prefix fell to 19 before
M6 and now occupies five opening comments while preserving all 19 logical
owners. The remaining page-wide comments are predominantly chart-internal,
order-bearing anchors or independent ownership ranges rather than a redundant
coextensive wrapper stack.

## 5. Test & perf strategy

- Every phase: full suite (incl. octane-prod), hydration suites (adoption
  identity assertions catch silent rebuilds), the website e2e (mismatch
  warnings), and NEW M0 structural pins.
- Mismatch-recovery paths (`clone` divergence discard, forBlock item guards)
  must be re-exercised where adoption expectations change — add a
  server-has-pair/client-expects-none fixture per M3 construct.
- Perf: same-session A/B on js-framework/dbmon/effectful-list. Expected
  neutral-to-positive (fewer DOM nodes, shorter walks); the singleRoot item
  precedent showed no cost. Memory is where wins may show (dbmon).
- Ratchet: `comments_1k` and the deterministic DOM-weight ratio guards tighten per phase.

## 6. Open questions

1. M5 now elides client-only inactive `@if` pairs and lets a guaranteed
   host-vs-host branch share a keyed-item boundary. General sole-root
   `@if`/`@switch` inheritance still needs a symmetric SSR/hydration design.
2. Empty branches still need one insertion anchor unless their position is
   recoverable from siblings. M5 removes the redundant pair but deliberately
   retains that single anchor.
